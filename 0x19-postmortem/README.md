Root Cause:

Plugin Conflict: The Apache 500 Error was primarily due to a conflict between a recently updated WordPress plugin and other plugins on our website. This conflict led to excessive resource consumption, causing server resource exhaustion and errors.

Resolution:

Disabling Problematic Plugins and Rollback: To resolve the issue:

    Identifying the Problematic Plugin: A thorough examination of logs revealed the conflicting plugin, “W3 Total Cache.”
    Temporary Disabling: The problematic plugin was temporarily disabled to reduce resource consumption and restore partial functionality.
    Rollback to Previous Version: A stable version of “W3 Total Cache” was restored to fully resolve the issue and regain full website functionality.
